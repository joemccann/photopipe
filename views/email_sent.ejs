  Oh hi, there.  You're viewing source so you're probably somewhat
  nerdy, geeky or you got here by accident.

  Nonetheless, did you know that PhotoPipe is 100% open source?
  Fuck yeah, it is.

  Go here:  http://github.com/joemccann/photopipe

  Don't see a service (like Flickr, 500px, etc.) on here?  Create
  a plugin and contribute.  If it's cool and it works, I'll merge
  it in and host it here!
