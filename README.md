PhotoPipe
=

PhotoPipe is a node service that takes an URL of an image, writes it to disk
and then can redirect or pipe it to another web service, such as one that
only accepts binary uploads.

PhotoPipe has a plugins directory that ideally is a place you could post these photos.  One working example is there.

Feel free to add and even implement some of the services.
